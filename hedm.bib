@article{Edmiston2012,
    abstract = {This article quantitatively reconciles crystallographic
                and mechanics approaches to lattice refinement as
                part of X-ray diffraction procedures. The
                equivalence between the refinement based on
                unit-cell parameters to that based on a lattice
                deformation tensor is established from a fixed
                reference configuration. Justification for the small
                strain assumption, commonly employed in X-ray
                diffraction based stress analysis, is also
                derived. It is shown that relations based on
                infinitesimal strains are correct to within an error
                of quadratic order in strain. This error may be
                important to consider for high-precision or
                high-strain experiments. It is hoped that these
                results are of use for facilitating communication
                and collaboration between crystallography and
                experimental mechanics communities, for studies
                where X-ray diffraction data are the fundamental
                measurement.},
